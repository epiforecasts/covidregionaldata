# covidregionaldata 0.9.3

This release is currently under development

## New data sets

* Support for level 1 region data in Estonia (thanks to @RichardMN). See `?Estonia` for details.
* Support for level 1 region data in Vietnam (thanks to @biocyberman). See `?Vietnam` for details.

## Other changes

* Change the data source for Switzerland to draw data from the Swiss Federal Office of Public Health (FOPH)
* Updated code for accessing U.S. data as provided by @nytimes
* Updated the package logo to include the newly supported data sets.
* Reduced the number of package dependencies (@bisaloo and @RichardMN)
## Bug fixes

- Fixed a bug in the data sourced from Germany so that instead of treating it as a line list of individuals it is treated as a relatively finely resolved count data which needs to be summed up (by @sbfnk).

# covidregionaldata 0.9.2

This release adds support for the Covid19 Data Hub which includes Google and Apple mobility data amongst a large range of other data sets, data from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre which is at both the regional and national level, and individual sources for regional data from several countries. Package updates have been made in line with a software review at the [Journal of Open Source Software](https://github.com/openjournals/joss-reviews/issues/3290). Finally, this release exposes more of the testing infrastructure to users and adds a package hexsticker.

Thanks to @joseph-palmer, @RichardMN, and @kathsherratt for contributions towards this release.

## New features

* Support added for data sets from Covid19 Data Hub. This source aggregates a range of data at a national and subnational level and provides keys to link to mobility data provided by Apple and Google (by @joseph-palmer).
* Support added for data from the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). The source aggregates incidence data at the country and regional level for 34 UCPM Participating States plus Switzerland (by @joseph-palmer).
* Support added for data from the Netherlands provided by RVIM (English: National Institute for Public Health and the Environment). This source provides case, deaths and hospital admission data at the province and municipal levels (by @joseph-palmer).
* Support added for data from Switzerland and Liechtenstein collated by Canton Zurich (@OpenZH). This source provides case, deaths and hospital admission data at the canton level (by @RichardMN).
* Made package changes recomended in the JOSS review, including additional statements of need to the README, updates to the manuscript (paper.md) and fixes a bug of multiple sources for some countries. We are very grateful for the detailed feedback given by the JOSS reviewers and their help in improving this package.

## Changes to implemented data sources

* Increased the robustness of fetching UK NHS admissions by region. Rather than testing a single date for data we now look over the last 7 days and pick the most recent available data set (by @kathsherratt).

## Other changes

* Testing of classes updated to allow for at least one of `common_data_urls` or `level_data_urls` to be present. The previous default which forced the presence of `common_data_urls` meant that several classes had to define an empty field (by @joseph-palmer).
* Tests on data sets are now included as a method in `DataClass`. `test_regional-datasets` now calls the test function for all classes at each level. Data set specific tests (such as for NHS regions in the UK) are included as a `specific_tests` function within the country class, which is called by the parent (DataClass) `test` after performing standard checks. This allows all the code about a country to be defined in its own class. In addition, users can run tests interactively by calling the test method (e.g. `$test()`) (by @joseph-palmer)
* A function to create a template class and automatically add a github workflow file has been added. This makes adding a new data source for a country even easier as now you can call the function `make_new_data_source()` with the country / source name to add and it will set up the basic structure for you. There is also now a github check to make sure all new sources have a workflow set up (by @joseph-palmer).
* Adds `source_` fields to all data sets to help users properly attribute their data sources (by @RichardMN).

## Bug fixes

* An issue where the `Lithuania()` data set would ignore optional class specific arguments has been fixed (by @RichardMN).
* An issue where the `JHU()` source had multiple region codes for each country has been fixed, giving just one region code per country (by @joseph-palmer).

# covidregionaldata 0.9.1

This release adds support for data sets from John Hopkins University and the Google open data project. Both of these sources aggregate a range of data at national and subnational levels. It also contains a range of small fixes and improvements to documentation. Finally, this release adds optional data processing which will be extended in future releases (contributions warmly welcomed).

Thanks to @joseph-palmer, @RichardMN, and @kathsherratt for contributions towards this release.

## New features

* Support for data provided by John Hopkins University (by @joseph-palmer).
* Support for data provided by Google COVID-19 open data project (by @joseph-palmer).
* Added a `available_regions` method for all classes that shows level 1 regions with data available for the region of interest. This is of particular use when combined with the JHU or Google datasets where processing a large number of regions that are not required can take some time.
* Adds support for JHU or Google data to `get_national_data()`. This may also now be used to access lower level data from these sources  but it may be better to instead use the classes directly or via `initialise_dataclass()`.

## Other changes

* The optional downloading of NHS region data in the `UK()` has been improved to include both the dynamic data previously supported and the archive document now produced (by @kathsherratt).
* The examples for the `UK()` class have been expanded to better showcase the package functionality.
* The documentation and examples for `get_regional_data()`, `get_national_data()`, and `get_available_datasets()` has been expanded with a focus on increasing the visibility of the underlying package structure.
* The documentation and examples for `initialise_dataclass()`, `DataClass()`, and `CountryDataClass()` has been expanded and improved.
* Improvements to the linking of documentation for related functions and classes.
* Improvements to the documentation for contributors (by @RichardMN).
* Improvements to the `pkgdown` documentation to organise packages into appropriate subcategories.

# covidregionaldata 0.9.0

In this release `covidregionaldata` has been substantially retooled to be more robust, and to handle data in a more transparent way. Adding new data sets and functionality has also been made more streamlined. As this update is a substantial package refactor some breaking changes may be been inadvertently introduced. If requiring the old behaviour please install `covidregionaldata@0.8.3` from GitHub.

Thanks to @joseph-palmer, @RichardMN, and @kathsherratt for major contributions to this release. Thanks to @RichardMN for volunteering his time.

## New features

* Track data processing from raw to clean using the `step = TRUE` argument in `get_regional_data()`.
* Filter datasets for regions and countries of interest.
* Access the underlying methods for data sets and all steps in the data processing pipeline.

## Documentation

* All vignettes have been updated for readability.
* A quickstart has been added to the package README.

## Technical improvements

* `get_regional_data()` and `get_national_data()` now use R6 method dispatch. This is an internal change and so should have minimal user impact for users of the `get_` functions. However, all datasets are now available to be used as R6 methods (see `get_available_datasets`) which may allow for more modular use cases. These classes can also be initialised using `initialise_dataclass()` which is used internally by both `get_regional_data()` and `get_national_data()`.
* Unit testing has been separated from data downloading which is now tested individually by data set. This allows for contributors to more easily assess the impact of their additions and also allows us to publish data status updates for each data sets (see the README: <https://github.com/epiforecasts/covidregionaldata#readme>).

## Deprecated functions

* `get_available_datasets()` replaces `get_info_covidregionaldata()` to view available data. `get_info_covidregionaldata()` is deprecated.
* `get_interventions_data()` is deprecated. These data no longer update as of December 2020. Check for alternatives at <https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/policy-trackers/>
* `get_linelist` is deprecated. Linelist stopped updating June 2020. Up to date linelist data are now behind a login: access at <https://global.health/>. We are working on a solution for accessing with `covidregionaldata`.

## Data changes since 0.8.3

* Colombia now has capitalized region names.
* Germany level 2 region codes have been removed (previously was all NAs).
* India uses NA for unknown region codes, a change from IN-UN previously.
* Italy column region is now regioni.
* Mexico codes 'inegi_code' has been changed to 'inegi'.
* UK Level 1 'ons_region_code' is now 'region_code'.
* UK level 2 "ltla_code" is now "local_authority_code".
* `get_available_datasets()` now return an origin column rather than a country column and a type column rather than a get_data_function to better reflect the types of data supported.

# covidregionaldata 0.8.3

## New data sets

* Level 1 admin data for Cuba
* Level 1 admin data for South Africa

## Data set changes

* UK data - added option to get either lower tier or upper tier local authorities (level 2 regions).
* Updated Northern Ireland case data to be by specimen date by default rather than by date of report as was previously the case. This means that in the UK all data except for data streams from Wales and Scotland are by date of specimen.
* Switched to the WHO source as our default for national level data.

## New features

* Relevant up to date package information can be fetched using `get_info_covidregionaldata()`.
* Switched to using `vroom` for faster `csv` downloads.

## Other changes

* Replaced silently broken functions for converting cumulative data to daily and vice versa.
* Removed integration with Covid19R formatting.
* UK data - removed hospital admissions by age, and occupied mechanical ventilation beds. Currently, these don't fit into the existing data structure and are not available at lower level regions.
* Removed code that required ECDC variables to work.
* Update the ECDC source to pull data from the new weekly snapshots. Updated the variables. In a later update the downloading the now archived daily data will be made possible.

# covidregionaldata 0.8.2

* Updates the API backend used to extract UK data to V2. Adds a release date variable which can be used to return data releases from specified dates rather than the latest snapshot.
* Various fixes to maintain compatibility with data set sources.
* Adds a quickstart vignette with examples of exploratory data analysis.

# covidregionaldata 0.7.0

## Breaking changes

* `get_linelist`: argument `clean` changed to `clean_dates` to reflect slight change in use case.

## Changes

* Added new option to return UK data by NHS region. This will also return "first admissions" hospital data (excludes readmissions). Specify 'nhsregions = TRUE'. Default is FALSE, returning ONS regions as before.
* Fixed inconsistent reference dates for variables in UK data. cases_new and cases_total now by "Specimen date" (date of test), while deaths_new and deaths_total are by "Date of death", for all regions and nations.

* Additional delays added to `get_linelist` when `clean_dates = TRUE`.

# covidregionaldata 0.6.0

* Added whitespace trimming to all regional data functions.
* Fixed region codes for Colombia.
* Fixed region name cleaning for afghanistan.
* Updated UK data source and expanded available variables based on the newly implemented API.
* Enabled regional localisation to be optional.
* Minor quality of life changes.

# covidregionaldata 0.5.0

* Release candidate.

# covidregionaldata 0.4.0

* Added functions to extract regional cases for Spain, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

# covidregionaldata 0.3.0

* Added a function to extract case counts by region for Italy.
* Function to extract ECDC cases.
* Added a function to extract case counts by region in Germany.
* Fixed cache reset.
* Added a `covidregionaldata` cache of the public linelist as a fall back option if the source is not available.

# covidregionaldata 0.2.0

* Added `memoise` functionality to automatically cache in the current directory all remote resources.
* Added a non-Hubei linelist function that can extract country and city linelists.
* Added a function to extract the latest WHO case counts.
* Added a function to summarise the current total number of cases.

# covidregionaldata 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added `get_linelist` function
* Added functions to reparameterise Weibull and Gamma distributions with mean and standard deviations.
