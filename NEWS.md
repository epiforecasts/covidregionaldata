# covidregionaldata 0.9.0

This update contains a substantial package refactor and as such introduces some breaking changes. If requiring the old behaviour please install `covidregionaldata@0.8.3` from GitHub.

## Changes

* Available datasets not listed in `get_available_datasets`.
* Refactored `get_regional_data` and `get_national_data` to use R6 method dispatch. This is mostly an internal change and so should have minimal user impact. However, all datasets are now available to be used as R6 methods (see `get_available_datasets)
* Added a list return method so that data processing changes can be tracked.
* Surfaced the underlying methods which may be of use for users.
* Separated unit testing of package functionality from testing of data downloads.
* `get_interventions_data()` is deprecated. These data no longer update as of December 2020. Check for alternatives at https://supertracker.spi.ox.ac.uk/policy-trackers/
* `get_linelist` is deprecated. Linelist stopped updating June 2020. Up to date linelist data are now behind a login: access at https://global.health/. We are working on a solution for accessing with `covidregionaldata`.

# covidregionaldata 0.8.3

## New data sets

* Level 1 admin data for Cuba
* Level 1 admin data for South Africa

## Data set changes

* UK data - added option to get either lower tier or upper tier local authorities (level 2 regions).
* Updated Northern Ireland case data to be by specimen date by default rather than by date of report as was previously the case. This means that in the UK all data except for data streams from Wales and Scotland are by date of specimen.
* Switched to the WHO source as our default for national level data.

## New features

* Relevant up to date package information can be fetched using `get_info_covidregionaldata()`.
* Switched to using `vroom` for faster `csv` downloads.

## Other changes

* Replaced silently broken functions for converting cumulative data to daily and vice versa.
* Removed integration with Covid19R formatting.
* UK data - removed hospital admissions by age, and occupied mechanical ventilation beds. Currently, these don't fit into the existing data structure and are not available at lower level regions.
* Removed code that required ECDC variables to work.
* Update the ECDC source to pull data from the new weekly snapshots. Updated the variables. In a later update the downloading the now archived daily data will be made possible.

# covidregionaldata 0.8.2

* Updates the API backend used to extract UK data to V2. Adds a release date variable which can be used to return data releases from specified dates rather than the latest snapshot.
* Various fixes to maintain compatibility with data set sources.
* Adds a quickstart vignette with examples of exploratory data analysis.

# covidregionaldata 0.7.0

## Breaking changes

* `get_linelist`: argument `clean` changed to `clean_dates` to reflect slight change in use case.

## Changes

* Added new option to return UK data by NHS region. This will also return "first admissions" hospital data (excludes readmissions). Specify 'nhsregions = TRUE'. Default is FALSE, returning ONS regions as before.
* Fixed inconsistent reference dates for variables in UK data. cases_new and cases_total now by "Specimen date" (date of test), while deaths_new and deaths_total are by "Date of death", for all regions and nations.

* Additional delays added to `get_linelist` when `clean_dates = TRUE`.

# covidregionaldata 0.6.0

* Added whitespace trimming to all regional data functions.
* Fixed region codes for Colombia.
* Fixed region name cleaning for afghanistan.
* Updated UK data source and expanded available variables based on the newly implemented API.
* Enabled regional localisation to be optional.
* Minor quality of life changes.

# covidregionaldata 0.5.0

* Release candidate.

# covidregionaldata 0.4.0

* Added functions to extract regional cases for Spain, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
* Improved data extraction from the ECDC.
* Added minimal unit tests.

# covidregionaldata 0.3.0

* Added a function to extract case counts by region for Italy.
* Function to extract ECDC cases.
* Added a function to extract case counts by region in Germany.
* Fixed cache reset.
* Added a `covidregionaldata` cache of the public linelist as a fall back option if the source is not available.

# covidregionaldata 0.2.0

* Added `memoise` functionality to automatically cache in the current directory all remote resources.
* Added a non-Hubei linelist function that can extract country and city linelists.
* Added a function to extract the latest WHO case counts.
* Added a function to summarise the current total number of cases.

# covidregionaldata 0.1.0

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Added `get_linelist` function
* Added functions to reparameterise Weibull and Gamma distributions with mean and standard deviations.
