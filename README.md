An interface to subnational and national level Covid-19 data. For all countries supported, this includes a daily time-series of cases. Wherever available we also provide  data on deaths, hospitalisations, and tests. National level data is also supported using a range of data sources as well as linelist data and links to intervention data sets.

[![Documentation](https://img.shields.io/badge/Package-documentation-lightgrey.svg?style=flat)](https://epiforecasts.io/covidregionaldata/)

First load the package using:

```r
library(covidregionaldata)
```

To get worldwide time-series data by country (sourced from the WHO), use `get_national_data()`:
``` r
get_national_data()
```

To get time-series data for subnational regions of a specific country, for example by local authority in the UK, use `get_regional_data()`:

```r
get_regional_data(country = "UK", include_level_2_regions = TRUE)
```

Subnational regions are only available in some countries. See the package documentation for further details.
