\section{OSP Data fields}{


The \href{https://osp.stat.gov.lt}{Official Statistics Portal} (OSP) provides
many data series in their table.

The full range of these vectors can be returned by setting
\code{all_osp_fields} to \code{TRUE}.

The following describes the data provided by the OSP.\tabular{ll}{

\code{*} The \code{municipality_code} is discarded since it does not correspond

\code{+} These fields are renamed but returned unmodified.

\verb{#} Lithuania offers counts according to three
different definitions of whether a death is attributable to COVID-19.

\code{$} This field is not recalculated for counties and is deleted.
}

\section{Criteria for attributing deaths}{


Beginning in February 2021 the OSP publishes death counts according to
three different criteria, from most to least strictly attributed to
COVID-19.
\enumerate{
\item \emph{\code{of}} Number of deaths with COVID-19 (coronavirus infection) as
the leading cause of death. The indicator is calculated by summing
all registered records of medical form E106 (unique persons), in which
the main cause of death is IPC disease codes U07.1 or U07.2. Deaths
due to external causes are not included (ICD disease codes are V00-Y36,
or Y85-Y87, or Y89, or S00-T79, or T89-T98).
\item \emph{\code{with}} Number of deaths with COVID-19 (coronavirus infection) of
any cause of death.
The indicator is calculated by summing all registered records of the
medical form E106 (unique persons), in which the ICD disease codes
U07.1, U07.2, U07.3, U07.4, U07.5 are indicated as the main, direct,
intermediate cause of death or other important pathological condition,
or identified as related to COVID-19 disease (coronavirus infection).
Deaths due to external causes are not included (ICD disease codes
are V00-Y36, or Y85-Y87, or Y89, or S00-T79, or T89-T98).
\item \emph{\code{after}} Number of deaths from any cause of COVID-19 or COVID-19
deaths due to non-external causes within 28 days.
The indicator is calculated by summing all registered records of the
medical form E106 (unique persons), in which the ICD disease codes
U07.1, U07.2, U07.3, U07.4, U07 are indicated as the main, direct,
intermediate cause of death or other important pathological condition,
or identified as related to COVID-19 disease (coronavirus infection)
and all records of medical form E106 (unique individuals) where the
person died within the last 28 days after receiving a positive
diagnostic response to the SARS-CoV-2 test or had an entry in medical
form E025 with ICD disease code U07.2 or U07.1. Deaths due to external
causes are not included (ICD disease codes are V00-Y36, or Y85-Y87, or
Y89, or S00-T79, or T89-T98).
}

The number of deaths reported in the last day is preliminary and
increases by about 20-40\% in a few days. Such a "delay" in the data is
natural: for example, for those who died last night, a death certificate
is likely to be issued as soon as this report is published this morning.
}

\section{De jure and statistical counts}{


Beginning in February 2021 the OSP makes statistical estimates
of the number of recovered and active cases, since review of the data
showed that some cases individuals still considered as active cases
had recovered, but not documented or registered as such.

These are listed as by the OSP as \code{active_de_jure} and
\code{recovered_de_jure} (officially still considered sick),
and \code{active_sttstcl} and \code{recovered_sttstcl} (an estimate of how
many of these are still ill).
