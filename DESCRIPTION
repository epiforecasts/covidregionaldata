Description: An interface to subnational and national level COVID-19 data
    sourced from both official sources, such as Public Health England in
    the UK, and from other COVID-19 data collections, including the World
    Health Organisation (WHO), European Centre for Disease Prevention and
    Control (ECDC), John Hopkins University (JHU), Google Open Data and
    others. Designed to streamline COVID-19 data extraction, cleaning, and
    processing from a range of data sources in an open and transparent
    way. This allows users to inspect and scrutinise the data, and tools
    used to process it, at every step. For all countries supported, data
    includes a daily time-series of cases. Wherever available data is also
    provided for deaths, hospitalisations, and tests. National level data
    are also supported using a range of sources.
