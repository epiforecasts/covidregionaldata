Description: An interface to subnational and national level Covid-19 data.
    For all countries supported, this includes a daily time-series of
    cases.  Wherever available we also provide data on deaths,
    hospitalisations, and tests.  National level data is also supported
    using a range of data sources as well as linelist data and links to
    intervention data sets. Data sources included: WHO
    <https://covid19.who.int>; ACAPS interventions
    <https://data.humdata.org/dataset/acaps-covid19-government-measures-dataset>;
    patient linelist: <https://github.com/beoutbreakprepared/nCoV2019>),
