Description: An interface to subnational and national level COVID-19 data.
    For all countries supported, this includes a daily time-series of
    cases.  Wherever available we also provide data on deaths,
    hospitalisations, and tests.  National level data is also supported
    using a range of data sources as well as line list data and links to
    intervention data sets.
